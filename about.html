<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am a graphic designer living in Brooklyn, NY. I became interested in Front-End Web Design and Development because I want to be confident when applying for web design jobs, and build my portfolio. (And I think web design is fun!)</p>
<br>
<h2>My Mission</h2>
<p>As I learn more about front-end web design, I hope to one day work as a web designer with a non-profit organization or a small agency. I would like to extend my learning to UI/UX design, and learn more about how people interact with web sites and web design.</p>
