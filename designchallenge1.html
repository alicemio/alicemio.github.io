	<h1>Design Challenge 1 </h1>
	<h1><em>Which two websites are you most inspired by?</em></h1>
	<p>I am inspired by <a href= "http://www.barnbrook.net/index.html">Barnbrook's website</a> and <a href="https://vimeo.com/"> Vimeo's website</a>.</p> 
	<h1><em>How do they exhibit effective use of space, size or balance?</em></h1><p>Barbook's website effectivly use negative space, color, and scale as a way to emphasize focal points. The background is filled with large images of their potfolio pieces in a grid, and adds contrast to the white background that they place their text in. Vimeo's homepage uses a changing video background that is appropriate for the video hosting site. The dynamic background that wraps corner to corner almost adds another layer of space and engages the viewers immediately. When the viewer scrolls, the site is introduced through icons and text, and there is a grid-based video gallery that shows videos that were picked by Vimeo's staff. </p>
	<h1> <em>What makes them similar and different?</h1></em><p> They are both grid-based sites that uses the background to immediately capture the site's visitor. Both sites have a navigation bar on the left side.Vimeo has a vertical scrolling homepage that shows the many facets of Vimeo. At the top of the page, Vimeo's name and slogan, "Your videos will love it here" is centered as the focal point. There is a sign up box to easily join with your name and email. At the bottom of the page, the user can choose again to join the community or to log in. There is also a more elaborate navigation area at the footer. Barnbrook's homepage is contained in a traditional homepage scale and it highlights the important information for the viewer to see without scrolling or moving throughout the page. </p>
	<h1>Thumbnail Sketches</h1>
	<ul>
	<li> <strong>Barnbrook's Homepage:</strong></p>
	<img src="images/BarnbrookSite.jpg" alt="Barnbrook" style="width: 700px"></li>
	<p> The negative space that surrounds the text creates a focal point for the contact information and navigation bar for Barnbrook's homepage. The background images dominate the homepage because they eliminate negative space. The negative space that surrounds the contact text and the navigation links are also important, along with the link to the Selected Portfolio. There is a good balance between large images and small text.  </p>
	<li><strong>Vimeo's Homepage:</strong></p>
	<img src="images/VimeoSite.jpg" alt="VImeo" style="width: 700px"></li>
	<p> The Vimeo homepage's focal point is their name and slogan centered on the page and the sign up box that makes joining vimeo an effortless task. The homepage is dominated by the moving video background, a new feature available through HTML5. There is a good balance created with negative space around the text and links.  </p>
